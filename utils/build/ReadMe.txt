NOTE: compiler.py also has the same code appended from from minify-directives.py.

Run compiler.py and then run minify-directives.py.

The purpose of minify-directives.py is to further minify and obfuscate by replacing element IDs, classes, directives, css identifiers with IDs, e.g., "_0", "_1", "_2", etc.
